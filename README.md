# ðŸš€ Movies-ETL
Challenge Week8 Data Analysis BootCamp using Python/ Jupyter Lab / Pandas / Numpy / SQL

Amazing Prime wants to keep  the data set and update it on a daily basis. Britta needs your help to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. Youâ€™ll need to refactor the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three filesâ€”Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating dataâ€”and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
